        <p>Samantha, I made this website to ask you to be my Valentine because our love means so much to me and I want to make sure you know you are appreciated. I also wanted to tell you you're lucky I'm in Ohio right now because I would be all over you right now and you wouldn't be able to get any work done or even leave your room.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being the best girlfriend ever, you make my day everyday and I want nothing more than to be with you 24/7 starting tomorrow. Hugs and kisses </p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
